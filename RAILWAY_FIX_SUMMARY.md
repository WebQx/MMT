# Railway Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue
Railway was unable to find and execute the `start.sh` script, resulting in "Application not found" errors and the backend being unreachable.

## Root Cause
1. Railway's Nixpacks builder had issues executing the bash script
2. Missing required environment variables for production mode
3. The application required `INTERNAL_JWT_SECRET` in production but it wasn't configured

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Updated Railway Configuration (`railway.toml`)
- Changed startCommand from `./start.sh` to `python run.py`
- Added required environment variables including `INTERNAL_JWT_SECRET`
- Configured proper production settings

### 2. Created Python-based Startup Script (`run.py`)
- More reliable than bash scripts on Railway
- Automatically sets required environment variables
- Uses proper gunicorn configuration for production

### 3. Enhanced Start Script (`start.sh`)
- Added automatic `INTERNAL_JWT_SECRET` generation if missing
- Better error handling and logging
- Configured proper defaults for Railway environment

### 4. Added Nixpacks Configuration (`nixpacks.toml`)
- Explicit build instructions for Railway's Nixpacks
- Ensures proper Python environment setup
- Sets executable permissions correctly

## Files Modified

1. `/backend/railway.toml` - Updated Railway deployment configuration
2. `/backend/start.sh` - Enhanced with better error handling and defaults
3. `/backend/run.py` - NEW: Python-based startup script
4. `/backend/nixpacks.toml` - NEW: Nixpacks build configuration

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push these changes to your repository
2. Redeploy on Railway - it should now detect and use the Python startup script
3. The backend should be accessible at `https://mmt-backend-production.up.railway.app/health/live`

## Testing Commands

After deployment, test with:
```bash
curl https://mmt-backend-production.up.railway.app/health/live
```

Expected response:
```json
{"status":"live"}
```
