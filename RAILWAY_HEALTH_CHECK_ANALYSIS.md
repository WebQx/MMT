# Railway Health Check Failure Analysis

## Issue Identified ✅
- **Build**: ✅ Successful (83.55 seconds)
- **Deployment**: ❌ Health check failures at `/health/live`
- **Timeout**: Application not responding within 30 seconds

## Root Cause
The application is starting but either:
1. **Slow startup** - Taking longer than 30s to become ready
2. **Database connection issues** - Hanging on MySQL connection
3. **Port binding problems** - App not binding to correct port
4. **Health endpoint not working** - `/health/live` endpoint failing

## Immediate Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Increase Health Check Timeout
The app might just need more time to start with MySQL.

### Fix 2: Check Runtime Logs
Need to see what's happening during the 30-second startup period.

### Fix 3: Simplify Health Check
Make health check more permissive during startup.
