## Git LFS configuration
# Keep this minimal. Avoid tracking build artifacts or ephemeral SDK files.
# Add only genuinely versioned large assets (e.g., reference model weights, curated sample datasets).

# Example (commented) patterns you can uncomment when needed:
# *.bin filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
# *.model filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
# assets/large/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
# Currently no large assets are tracked intentionally.

# Added after LFS migration (large historical blobs moved to LFS):
*.gz filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
*.wasm filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
main.dart.js filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
*.gz filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
*.wasm filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
main.dart.js filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
