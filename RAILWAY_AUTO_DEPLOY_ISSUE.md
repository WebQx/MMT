# Railway Auto-Deployment Not Working

## Issue
Railway is not automatically deploying when code is pushed to GitHub repository.

## Possible Causes

### 1. **Repository Not Connected**
- Railway service might not be linked to GitHub repository
- Webhook not configured properly
- Wrong branch configured for deployment

### 2. **Service Configuration Issues**
- Service might be set to manual deployment only
- Deployment trigger settings incorrect
- Railway watching wrong repository/branch

### 3. **Railway Project Structure**
- Multiple services in project might be causing confusion
- Service names not matching expectations

## Solutions to Try

### Option 1: Manual Redeploy
Via Railway Dashboard:
1. Go to https://railway.app/project/49749dfc-af4f-44b4-be7f-9f6411aee691
2. Find your backend service
3. Click "Deploy" â†’ "Redeploy"
4. This will force Railway to pull latest code

### Option 2: Check Repository Connection
1. In Railway service settings
2. Look for "Source" or "Repository" section
3. Verify it's connected to `WebQx/MMT` repository
4. Check if it's watching the `main` branch

### Option 3: Force Connection Reset
1. Disconnect repository from Railway
2. Reconnect with proper permissions
3. Ensure webhooks are configured

### Option 4: CLI Force Deploy
If Railway CLI is working:
```bash
railway login
railway deploy
```

## Quick Manual Test
Try manual redeploy first to see if the new configuration works when forced.
