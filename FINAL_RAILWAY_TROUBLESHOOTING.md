# Final Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Status
- **MySQL**: ✅ Running successfully on Railway  
- **Code**: ✅ All fixes pushed to repository
- **Backend**: ❌ Still returning "Application not found"

## Critical Checks Needed

### 1. **Check Railway Dashboard Services**
Visit: https://railway.app/project/49749dfc-af4f-44b4-be7f-9f6411aee691

**Verify:**
- [ ] Both MySQL and Backend services are visible
- [ ] Backend service is actually deploying (not stuck)
- [ ] Backend service shows "Deployed" status (not "Failed")

### 2. **Check Latest Deployment Logs**
In the Backend service → Deployments tab:

**Look for:**
```
Starting MMT Backend on Railway... (MySQL configured)
MySQL database detected from Railway
Database configured: [user]@[host]:3306/[database]
config/validated prod=True
```

**Red flags:**
```
Error: Could not connect to MySQL
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named...
Port already in use
Health check failed
```

### 3. **Verify Environment Variables**
In Backend service → Variables tab:

**Railway should provide:**
- [ ] `MYSQLHOST` (from MySQL service)
- [ ] `MYSQLPORT` (usually 3306)
- [ ] `MYSQLUSER` (from MySQL service)
- [ ] `MYSQLPASSWORD` (from MySQL service)
- [ ] `MYSQLDATABASE` (from MySQL service)

**Our config provides:**
- [ ] `ENV=prod`
- [ ] `INTERNAL_JWT_SECRET`
- [ ] `ALLOW_GUEST_AUTH=true`

### 4. **Service Networking**
- [ ] Ensure Backend and MySQL services are in the same Railway project
- [ ] Check if services can communicate (Railway handles this automatically)

## Possible Issues

### **Issue 1: Service Not Linked**
If variables tab doesn't show `MYSQL*` variables:
- MySQL service might not be linked to backend
- Services might be in different projects
- **Fix**: Delete and re-add MySQL service, ensure it's in same project

### **Issue 2: Build Failures**
If deployment shows build errors:
- Check Build tab for Python/dependency errors
- **Fix**: Build logs will show specific missing packages

### **Issue 3: Runtime Failures**
If builds succeed but app doesn't start:
- Check Deploy/Runtime logs for startup errors
- **Fix**: Usually database connection or missing environment variables

### **Issue 4: Port/Health Check Issues**
If app starts but health checks fail:
- App might be binding to wrong port
- Health check path might be incorrect
- **Fix**: Check if PORT environment variable is being used

## Quick Test Steps

### **Step 1: Force Redeploy**
In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to Backend service
2. Click "Deploy" → "Redeploy"
3. Monitor build and deploy logs

### **Step 2: Check Raw Logs**
Look for the exact error message preventing startup

### **Step 3: Simplify for Testing**
If MySQL is still causing issues, temporarily test with:
```
ENV=dev
DEMO_MODE=true
```
This should allow SQLite and help isolate MySQL issues.

## Expected Working Result

When fixed, you should see:
```bash
curl https://mmt-backend-production.up.railway.app/health/live
# Response: {"status":"live"}
```

## Next Actions Required

1. **Check Railway dashboard** for specific error messages
2. **Share deployment logs** if you see specific errors
3. **Verify service linking** between Backend and MySQL
4. **Consider simplifying** to isolate the root cause

The configuration is correct - we just need to identify what's preventing the Railway deployment from starting.
