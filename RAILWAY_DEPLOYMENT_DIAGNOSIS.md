# Railway Deployment Diagnosis

## Current Issue
Backend is still returning "Application not found" after MySQL setup.

## Possible Causes

### 1. **MySQL Connection Issues**
- Railway MySQL environment variables not properly linked
- App failing to start due to database connection errors
- MySQL service not accessible from backend service

### 2. **Service Configuration**
- Railway might not be deploying to the correct service
- Service naming or linking issues

### 3. **Environment Variables**
- MySQL variables not being injected properly
- Railway.toml configuration not being applied

## Manual Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Railway Dashboard
1. Go to: https://railway.app/project/49749dfc-af4f-44b4-be7f-9f6411aee691
2. Check the **Deployments** tab for build/runtime errors
3. Look at **Variables** tab to ensure MySQL vars are set:
   - `MYSQLHOST`
   - `MYSQLPORT` 
   - `MYSQLUSER`
   - `MYSQLPASSWORD`
   - `MYSQLDATABASE`

### 2. Check Deployment Logs
Look for these error patterns:
```
Error: Could not connect to MySQL
Connection refused
Access denied for user
Unknown database
```

### 3. Service Linking
- Ensure your backend service is linked to the MySQL service
- Check if services are in the same Railway project
- Verify service-to-service networking

## Quick Fixes to Try

### Option 1: Manual Environment Variables
If MySQL addon variables aren't working, set them manually:
```
TRANSCRIPTS_DB_HOST=<mysql-host>
TRANSCRIPTS_DB_PORT=3306
TRANSCRIPTS_DB_USER=<mysql-user>
TRANSCRIPTS_DB_PASSWORD=<mysql-password>
TRANSCRIPTS_DB_NAME=<mysql-database>
```

### Option 2: Temporary SQLite for Testing
To isolate if it's a MySQL issue, temporarily allow SQLite:
```
ENV=dev
DEMO_MODE=true
```

### Option 3: Check Service Names
Your backend service might not be named "backend" - check actual service name in Railway dashboard.

## Expected Working State

Once fixed, you should see:
```bash
curl https://mmt-backend-production.up.railway.app/health/live
# Response: {"status":"live"}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Check Railway dashboard logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify MySQL service is running** and accessible
3. **Ensure environment variables are properly set**
4. **Check service linking** between backend and MySQL
